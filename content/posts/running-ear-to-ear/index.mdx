A few years ago, I wasn't having the best day. The reasons don't matter much, they just added up to me being in a bad mood. So, I did what I usually did when I was in a bad mood, I went for a run.

<br/>

On my run I passed a mother pushing a stroller and her young son walking beside her. 

Moments after I passed, I heard the pitter patter of the young boy racing up behind me. 

I slowed my stride a little and he passed me. 

I then sped up slightly and we raced neck-to-neck.

As we approached the intersection, I took dramatic steps, waved my arms to my sides, and came to a stop.

He quickly stopped, looked back at me and I said, "You won!"

He jumped up and down. I gave him a high five and said, "Nice Job!"

He looked back at me smiling ear-to-ear and said, "You're good!"

Then, in the distance, we both heard his mom yelling, "Get back here!"

I looked at him and went, "Uh ohhh."

Still smiling, he ran back towards his mom.

I ran the other way. Smiling ear-to-ear.

<br/>

Years later, I don't remember the reasons why I was in a bad mood. However, I do remember that young boy helping me find a better mood. Go help someone find a better mood today.
