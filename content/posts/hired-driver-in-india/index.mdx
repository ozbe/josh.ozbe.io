In September 2017, my partner and I traveled to India to attend a wedding and explore some of the country. We hired a driver to get us from place-to-place, as we were warned that driving in India can be difficult and, well, scary. Here was our first interaction with the driver after getting in his vehicle:

<br/>

First thing we both do is reach for our respective seat belts and fail to find them. We look at each other confused. Maybe they are detached or behind something? Let's ask, "Where are the seat belts?"

"You don't need them," the driver assured us.

"Sorry?"

"No law. Don't need them."

"Oh, but we want them."

The driver firmly responded, "They're gone."

After looking a bit closer we see that the seat belts have been cut out.

Curious, we ask, "Why did you cut them out?"

"They get in the way."

Yeah, they get in the way of us dying.

<br/>

Needless to say the driver got us from place-to-place safely and he was right, we "didn't need them." I still would have preferred to have the option to use them though. Maybe next time.
