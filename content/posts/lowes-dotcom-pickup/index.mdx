   I've just entered a Lowe's Home Improvement to pick up my online order.<br/>
   At the customer service desk inside there was a printed sign that read "lowes.com pickups are located ________". There really was an empty space with an underline.<br/>
   While trying to decipher the sign, an employee asked, "Can I help you?"<br/>
   I pointed at the sign and said, "I'm looking for the rest of that sign."<br/>
   "Huh?"<br/>
   "... I'm here for a dotcom pickup"<br/>
   "Lowe's?"<br/>
   "Yeah?" I inquisitively asked. What other order would I be looking for at Lowe's?<br/>
   "Ok. So you go down this way," as the employee pointed towards the far end of the store. "You'll see the paper towels on the right and the internet will be to your left"<br/>
   "The internet?"<br/>
   "Yeah, there is a doorway with a sign that says internet."<br/>
   "Ok then." What the hell, it can't be that complicated to find... the internet.

   After I find my way through the doorway labelled "the internet", there is a cashier behind the counter.<br/>
   "Hi, I have a dotcom order."<br/>
   "Do you have your order number?"<br/>
   "Yeah, here is the barcode," as I show the twelve digit number with a barcode on my phone.<br/>
   "Can you just read me the number? It's easier."<br/>
   Easier than scanning a barcode? "Yeah. 8... 2..."<br/>
   While slogging through the barcode I notice there are sliding doors that go directly to the outside from "the internet". That would have been helpful to know. Oh well, I have a quick route out of here.<br/>
   As I finish up with the cashier, I walk towards the sliding doors and smack right into them. They didn't open.<br/>
   The cashier _helpfully_ called out, "Those doors are broken!"<br/>
   A nice bookend to my pickup experience.

   I will add that I've usually had great success shopping at Lowe's. This experience happened to one of the exceptions.
