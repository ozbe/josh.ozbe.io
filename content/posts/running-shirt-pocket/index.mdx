title: Running Shirt Pocket

I was looking at one of my running shirts today and found myself wondering the purpose of the front chest pocket.

I think an obvious answer would be, “Its for a key!” But “put on shirt, put key in pocket that rests above your nipple, and go for run” sound like directions for how to quit running forever.

My best guess, the pocket is for those that wear the shirt on the couch and want to have licorice one neck movement away from their mouth.

Maybe its just as useful as the “This way up” sticker you see on boxes. “This way forward”. But I’ve just been using the tag and the awkward fit to identify that for years.

Does anyone use this pocket? Maybe I should stop procrastinating and just go on that run?
